# Progressive Web App Codelab

It's a weather web app using Progressive Web App
techniques. This app will:

* Use responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
* Be fast & reliable, using a service worker to precache the app resources
  (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run, and cache the weather data
  at runtime to improve performance.
* Be installable, using a web app manifest and the `beforeinstallprompt` event
  to notify the user it's installable.
